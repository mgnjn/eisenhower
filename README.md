# Task Manager

This app is a simple todo list with a slight variation of the todolist involving the use of the Eisenhower matrix instead, which has four quadrants. The eventual goal of this app is that the todolist self-updates and self-assigns the task to the quadrants based on various factor such as:

- weight / story points
- deadline date
- weekly focus
