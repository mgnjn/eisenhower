# Eisenhower

A simple todo list however a slight variation of the todolist involves using the Eisenhower Matrix instead, which has four quadrants. The eventual goal of this app is that todolist self-updates.

## Installation

1. Clone the app.

2. Run the backend

```
cd back
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Run the frontend

Same instructions as running the backend except replace `back` with `front`.
