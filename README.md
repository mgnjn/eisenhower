# Task Manager

This app is a simple todo list with a slight variation of the todolist involving the use of the Eisenhower matrix instead, which has four quadrants. The eventual goal of this app is that the todolist self-updates and self-assigns the task to the quadrants based on various factor such as:

- weight / story points
- deadline date
- weekly focus

## Installation

0. Before you can install the app, make sure you have npm installed.

1. Clone the app.

2. Run the backend

```
cd back
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Run the frontend

Same instructions as running the backend except replace `back` with `front`.

## Motivation

Create my own personal task manager.
